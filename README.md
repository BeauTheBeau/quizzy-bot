## Features

### Commands

- `[]` - optional argument
- `<>` - required argument


- **/quiz** `[topic]` `[difficulty]` `[numQuestions]`

  Host a quiz on a topic of your choice. Asks `numQuestions` questions of `difficulty` on `topic`.
  At the end of the quiz, the bot will display the score of each participant and announce the winner who will receive
  a point multiplier of 1.5x.

- **/randomQuestion** `[topic]` `[difficulty]`

  Get a random question on a topic of your choice. You receive 1 point for correctly answering an easy question, 2
  points for a medium question, and 5 points for a hard question.

### Random Quiz

QuizzyBot will randomly send a question to a pre-defined channel every hour (or whatever interval you choose). The
question will be on a random topic and difficulty. The first person to answer correctly will receive 1.5x the points
of the difficulty of the question. For example, if the question is hard, the first person to answer correctly will
receive 5 x 1.5 = 7.5 points, *but* rounded up to 8 points.
